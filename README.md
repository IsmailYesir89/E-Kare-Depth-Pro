# DepthProMap – Depth Estimation for Wound Assessment

**E-Kare Health Company** | AI Research Project

## 📌 Overview

**DepthProMap** is a computer vision system developed to estimate depth maps from 2D wound images, enabling non-contact 3D reconstruction and digital measurement of wounds. The project enhances the capabilities of wound assessment tools used in digital healthcare by integrating advanced AI models for monocular depth estimation.

This tool is part of E-Kare's mission to bring precision and automation to wound care management through intelligent image analysis.
